DESIGN PATTERNS:
* Creational Design Pattern - Abstract Factory
* Structural Design Pattern - Decorator
* Behavorial Design Pattern - Chain of Responsibility

BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED:
* Source file is lower than 2000 lines of code
* Source file is organized into different classes
* Classes use Pascal Naming Convention
* Method names are a mix of verb and adjective or noun that gives an idea of what the method does
* Variable names are short and easily tell what it represents
* Indentation is consistent with the use of tab
* Switch case has a default method
* Operators are separated by spaces for bette readability
* Comments are present

Note: Although this code is already playable and almost all necessary element are already present, this code is still far from perfect. It needs further improvement.
